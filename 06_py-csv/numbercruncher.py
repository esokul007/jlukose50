HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:

'''

import random
f = open("occupations.csv", "r")
text = f.read()
# convert data from .csv to a string, which we will then manipulate and transform into a dictionary

print(text)

dict = {}
pdict = {} # dictionary specific for percentage calculations
jobs = text.split('\n')
jobs = jobs[1:-1] #first line in a csv is always the column identifiers/labels, last line is "total"
#totalpercentage = 0   Used for debugging purposes

i = 0
prob = 0
while i < len(jobs) - 1:
    if jobs[i][0] != "\"":
        job = jobs[i].split(",")
        prob += float(job[1])
        dict[job[0]] = prob
        #totalpercentage += float(job[1])
    else:
        job = jobs[i].split("\"")
        prob +=float(job[2][1:])
        dict[job[1]] = prob
        
        #totalpercentage += float(job[2][1:])
    ## print(prob)
    i += 1

print(dict)
#print(len(dict))
#print(totalpercentage)     Used for debugging purposes
