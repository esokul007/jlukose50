DISCO:
- bootstrap doesn't have templates, a little harder to use compared to foundations
- very nice css styling, I do like it more than foundations, however foundations grid layout is a lot better
- tailwind is very nice
- predefined classes to style websites
- custom designs without css
- autoscales to fit features

QCC:
If I import multiple css files, which ones override which?

q0:
bootstrap: 1
source: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/contribute/

tailwind: 0

q1:
I prefer tailwind the best because styling wise it looks the best and it is also really easy to use. Foundations is really cool with the grid layout, but I feel like the aesthetics are lacking a little bit. Bootstrap was by far the worst, not very pretty and hard to figure out on my own.
