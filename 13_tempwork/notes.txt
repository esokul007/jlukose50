You can write css in html by using a <style> tag instead of the <head> tag
Link notation in html: <a href= LINK > TEXT </a>
csv file does not need values to be comma separated (good practice if exporting, but if just for this program...?)
Check to make sure you didn't confuse 1s and is when reading your code...



Egoless programming tldr:
Everyone has a mix of compliance, ambition, and detachedness (without connotations commonly attached to these words)
Unfortunately programmers tend to become very detached... except to 'their' code
Tend to be extensions of self
But not when the program is criticized / doesn't work
People tend to avoid criticism of themselves / their actions
This means programmers blame others / the machine for their code not working, when this is not the case

Need to be vigilant and be aware that flaws in code do exist, it is fact
Code written is code you have written but not yours
Get someone else without the biases you have to check the code you have written
More people having to understand also stops progress from being impeded when the person who wrote the code cannot work
(less variation in programming time)

working with others increases productivity and understanding

EGO:
Get others to read over your code
If working on a group project, make sure everybody contributes, and their contributions are reviewed by others
